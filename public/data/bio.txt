FULL_BIO:
Bob Baker is an experimental photographer based in Overland Park, Kansas, seeking ways to bend and shape light to form stories and evoke daydreams. His work draws from a wide spectrum of influences—Henri Cartier-Bresson's decisive moments, Daido Moriyama’s gritty candor, Vivian Maier’s quiet brilliance, Rothko’s emotional color fields, Matisse and Van Gogh’s expressive lines, and the immersive soundscapes of Tool, Glass Beams, and Carbon Based Lifeforms. Bob approaches photography as both a meditation and a therapeutic practice—a means of observing the world with intention and offering back moments of insight, mystery, and connection. He is deeply interested in physics, philosophy, art history, and spirituality, and weaves these threads through his images and process. Whether capturing fleeting human gestures or abstract textures of light, Bob’s work invites viewers into a layered dialogue—between self and subject, moment and memory, observer and the observed.

EARLY_LIFE:
Bob grew up in Overland Park, but spent his teens and twenties at the Lake of the Ozarks. His parents divorced when He was two years old, and he lived primarily with His mom until He was 12. Then He moved in with His dad at age 12 at the Lake of the Ozarks. He learned art and the humanities from His mom as a young child. She supplied him with art tools, crafts, books, music, varying spiritual practices from Native American to Eastern Hinduism. She taught him a lot about psychology and processing information. They built puzzles, stitched and burned leather wallets, raised lizards, turtles and a very special dog named Lady. Lady was a salt and pepper-colored miniature Schnauzer. He spent His time daydreaming, doing art projects, and riding His bike to Stoll Park, just South of Johnson County Community College. His best friends Nick and Natalie lived down the street. They'd play Nintendo and make up games and missions for themselves. His elementary school was Pleasant Ridge and They learned music, physics like magnets and weights, and had art classes where They learned about primary and secondary colors and the color spectrum. They learned about pioneers in America and Johnny Appleseed. They even did a musical about him. They introduced the kids to PC and Macintosh computers in the early 90s and They'd have a computer lab session each day. They'd also spend time each day in the library and They were very active with Scholastic Books. Their library had tiger sharks in tanks and They learned which side of the street to walk on, and how to use signaling when on a bicycle. Multiplication was taught very early along with pre-algebra and geometry. They even learned all the countries and their capitals of Africa. It was a wild and wonderful experience for him as a child learning about the world at such a rapid pace.
