FAVORITE COLOR:
Hex code #481B48, which is sometimes called Bob's Purple. It is a powerful deep purple perfectly balanced between red and blue and holds a special power of being represented by colors that are factors of three. RGB(72, 27, 72) or CMYK(0, 63, 0, 72). 

27 or Twenty-Seven or Trinity or Trinity of Trinities or Threes
Bob is fascinated with the number three and powers and multiples of three. 3x3=9 and 3 to the power of 3 = 27. Three is a powerful number in nature, as the triangle is the shape with the fewest sides, and the strongest frame of all the shapes. Our brains are captivated by the number three and seek out items in threes. In the context of Bob's work and interests, the number 3 might represent many things. It could symbolize the triadic color scheme in art, the three primary colors, or the rule of thirds in photography. It could also represent three forms of light: ambient, diffused, and specular, which Bob explores in his experimental photography. Additionally, in spirituality and philosophy, 3 is considered a sacred number, signifying harmony, wisdom, and understanding.

FULL_BIO:
Bob Baker is an experimental photographer based in Overland Park, Kansas, seeking ways to bend and shape light to form stories and evoke daydreams. His work draws from a wide spectrum of influences—Henri Cartier-Bresson's decisive moments, Daido Moriyama’s gritty candor, Vivian Maier’s quiet brilliance, Rothko’s emotional color fields, Matisse and Van Gogh’s expressive lines, and the immersive soundscapes of Tool, Glass Beams, and Carbon Based Lifeforms. Bob approaches photography as both a meditation and a therapeutic practice—a means of observing the world with intention and offering back moments of insight, mystery, and connection. He is deeply interested in physics, philosophy, art history, and spirituality, and weaves these threads through his images and process. Whether capturing fleeting human gestures or abstract textures of light, Bob’s work invites viewers into a layered dialogue—between self and subject, moment and memory, observer and the observed.

They built puzzles, stitched and burned leather wallets, raised lizards, turtles and a very special dog named Lady. Lady was a salt and pepper-colored miniature Schnauzer. He spent His time daydreaming, doing art projects, and riding His bike to Stoll Park, just South of Johnson County Community College. His best friends Nick and Natalie lived down the street. They'd play Nintendo and make up games and missions for themselves. His elementary school was Pleasant Ridge and They learned music, physics like magnets and weights, and had art classes where They learned about primary and secondary colors and the color spectrum. They learned about pioneers in America and Johnny Appleseed. They even did a musical about him. They introduced the kids to PC and Macintosh computers in the early 90s and They'd have a computer lab session each day. They'd also spend time each day in the library and They were very active with Scholastic Books. Their library had tiger sharks in tanks and They learned which side of the street to walk on, and how to use signaling when on a bicycle. Multiplication was taught very early along with pre-algebra and geometry. They even learned all the countries and their capitals of Africa. It was a wild and wonderful experience for him as a child learning about the world at such a rapid pace.
